Q1: How does Power BI handle large datasets in the Online Service, and what is the role of Premium Capacity in this?
A: Power BI Online uses in-memory storage for imported datasets, which are compressed for performance. In Pro workspaces, datasets are limited to 1 GB. Premium Capacity lifts this limit—allowing up to 400 GB per dataset—and provides dedicated resources, faster refresh rates, and support for features like incremental refresh and XMLA endpoints.

Q2: What are the differences between Import mode, DirectQuery, and Live Connection in Power BI Service?
A:
• 	Import Mode: Data is loaded into Power BI and stored in-memory. Fast performance, but not real-time.
• 	DirectQuery: Queries are sent live to the source database. Real-time data, but slower performance.
• 	Live Connection: Connects to external semantic models (e.g., SSAS). No data stored in Power BI; relies entirely on the source model.

Q3: Explain deployment pipelines in Power BI Online. What stages do they include?
A: Deployment pipelines help manage content across environments. They include three stages:
• 	Development: Build and test reports.
• 	Test: Validate with production-like data.
• 	Production: Final version for end users.
Premium users can automate transitions and compare content between stages.

Q4: How can Power BI Service integrate with Microsoft Teams or SharePoint for collaboration?
A:
• 	In Teams, you can embed reports in channels or chats for real-time collaboration.
• 	In SharePoint, use the Power BI web part to embed interactive reports directly into pages.
Both platforms support secure sharing and enhance teamwork around data.

Q5: What is the XMLA endpoint in Premium and how does it benefit developers or enterprise BI teams?
A: The XMLA endpoint allows external tools to connect to Power BI datasets using the XML for Analysis protocol. In Premium workspaces, it supports read/write access, enabling advanced modeling, debugging, and integration with tools like SSMS or Tabular Editor—ideal for enterprise BI workflows.

Q6: Describe how usage metrics and audit logs work in Power BI Service.
A:
• 	Usage Metrics: Show report views, user engagement, and frequency. Creators can customize these reports.
• 	Audit Logs: Available via Microsoft 365 compliance center. Track user actions like sharing, viewing, and editing—critical for governance and security.

Q7: How do you manage workspace access and permissions for different users?
A: Assign roles within a workspace:
• 	Admin: Full control.
• 	Member: Can edit content.
• 	Contributor: Can add content but not publish apps.
• 	Viewer: Read-only access.
You can also use Microsoft 365 groups or Azure AD to manage access centrally.

Q8: How can data governance be enforced in Power BI Service?
A: Governance is enforced through:
• 	Sensitivity labels and DLP policies (via Microsoft Purview)
• 	Audit logs and activity monitoring
• 	Row-Level and Object-Level Security
• 	Controlled sharing and workspace roles
These tools help ensure compliance and protect sensitive data.

Q9: What are the limitations of Row-Level Security when using DirectQuery or Live Connection?
A:
• 	Performance: RLS can slow down DirectQuery due to dynamic filtering.
• 	Complexity: Rules must be carefully designed to avoid errors.
• 	Live Connection: RLS must be defined in the source model (e.g., SSAS), not in Power BI.

Q10: Explain how you can refresh a dataset via Power Automate or REST API.
A:
• 	Power Automate: Use the “Refresh a dataset” action in a flow triggered by events like file uploads or schedules.
• 	REST API: Use the  endpoint to trigger refreshes programmatically. You can also monitor status and automate retries.
